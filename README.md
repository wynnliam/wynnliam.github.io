This is just my personal website. This is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)

You can actually see my site in action [here](https://wynnliam.github.io)

## How to run my page locally
To run this, make sure you have the following:
* Ruby. To check this is installed, run `ruby -v`.
* RubyGems. To check this is installed, run `gem -v`.
* GCC. To check this is installed, run `gcc -v` and `g++ -v`.
* Make. TO check this is installed, run `make -v`.

If these are not installed, check online to see how to install these for your
machine.

Once you have that. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

## Now wait, why would I want to do this?
You probably don't actually. This is mostly for me to remember the build commands.

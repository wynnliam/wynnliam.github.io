I feel like my first post should be a nice, warm welcoming post. So, here I am and welcome
to my site!

I've been meaning to do something like this for awhile. As a matter of fact,
I've tried to make sites with Google Sites, Wordpress, and a few others. However, I was never
satisfied with them. I think it's because I had a sense that those sites weren't really mine.
What I mean is that I didn't feel like I had to put in any effort to build those. I don't
know, I feel like using Jekyll and Github Pages requires me to build a lot more from scratch,
so it's really *mine* in some way.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy this page! There isn't a lot to navigate here, so you shouldn't
have any problems finding your way around.

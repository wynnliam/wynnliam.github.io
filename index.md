Hi all! Welcome to my website. My name is Liam Wynn. Let me tell you a bit about myself.

I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. I've lived here my entire life and as much as I
love to travel, I can't see myself leaving.

In September 2014, I began my journey as a Computer Science student at Portland State University.
However, even before starting I knew CS was my calling. I spent most of my free time after school
writing programs.

After five arduous but really amazing years, I graduated from PSU with a major in Computer Science
and a minor in Mathematics in August of 2019. I graduated with a GPA of 3.84, induction into the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society,
and made the Dean's List seven times.

While I'm a bookworm and nerd through and through, I do have a life beyond studying if you can believe
it. I love to go hiking, camping, and working out.
